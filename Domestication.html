        Unlike dogs, domesticated cats were nearly identical to their wild counterparts and remained highly independent. This meant that cats could not be fully domesticated. Around 10,000 - 15,000 years ago in the Middle East, a relationship developed between humans and cats when humans began relying on agriculture as opposed to hunter-gatherer methods for food. Cats initially became pest contol, helping keeping rodents out of crops. Domestic cats eventually spread throughout the world through trade routes as they were considered as companions. They even held high status in certain cultures, such as ancient Egypt.

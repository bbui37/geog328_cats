        Origin of cats
        <br>
        <br>
        The first feline-like mammal was the *Proailurus* which evolved about 30 million years ago. All true cat species are thought to have evolved from this predator. Cats that resemble the ones we know today first evolved 5.3 to 3.6 million years ago where they had few changes into the present time. The development of fangs, claws, agility, flexibile and muscular bodies allowed cats to survive and hunt while adapting to changing prey as well.
